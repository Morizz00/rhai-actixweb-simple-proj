#  Rhai Math API with Actix-Web

A lightweight web API built with **Actix-Web** and **Rhai** for performing basic math operations (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) using dynamic scripting. For now very basic but will enhance in future.

-  Fast HTTP server using [Actix-web](https://actix.rs/)
